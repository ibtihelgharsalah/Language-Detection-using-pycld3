# Language-Detection-using-pycld3
an AI model that automatically detects the language of a given text supported by 3 pre-trained NLP models using the following python packages :

- LangDetect : detects the language of a given text among over 50 languages and provides a probability of that language being correct.
- Langid : detects the language of a given text among 97 different languages.
- Pycld3 : detects the language of a given text among over 100 different languages and provides a probability of that language, a reliability test and its proportion in the whole database.

And one machine learning algorithm :
- NaiveBayes : determines whether a given text is in french or in english.
